# Scripts

This directory contains additional scripts that might be necessary to work with our code. First of all, it provides scripts necessary to convert the datasets used in this project into the appropriate format (linearized tables). Further, it provides scripts for then preprocessing this data for the INP task. _parent_score_ contains everything that is needed to convert the linearized representations of tables into the format required by the PARENT score.

None of these scripts works with command-line arguments. Please specify data directories directly in the scripts using the given constants.
